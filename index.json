The library is designed for ease of use, and has an API much like that of a standard \u0026ldquo;internet socket\u0026rdquo;-type library (except, of course, that the bits are flowing over third-party services).\n  \nThere is a companion blog post to this talk here.\nThere is also a companion project page here.\n","permalink":"http://dakotanelson.com/publications/social-media-c2/","tags":null,"title":"Social Media C2"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This paper, published my senior year of high school in the Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges, gives an overview of near field communication (NFC) security.\nThe abstract is:\n With the booming of smartphone and wireless networks, contactless payment systems have been gradually accepted by a range of sectors and industries. Near Field Communication (NFC), as a de facto standard for radio communication, dominates this market and has accumulated many applications, such as use as a digital wallet and ticketing system, due to its convenience and versatility. The prevalent use and large cash flow of NFC have attracted the attention of attackers and criminals. In this paper, we present an overview of the security issues surrounding the NFC protocol and its applications. We investigate the existing and potential vulnerabilities of NFC, discuss effective countermeasures for mitigating these vulnerabilities, and further present design considerations for new NFC applications.\n You can find it in the ACM digital library.\n","permalink":"http://dakotanelson.com/publications/nfc-security/","tags":null,"title":"Security of the Near Field Communication Protocol"},{"categories":null,"contents":"As of June 2019, I\u0026rsquo;m the #8 contributor to Empire by commits. I\u0026rsquo;ve added several fairly major features, most notably the Empire plugin system, a complete overhaul of the system Empire uses to handle events and pass messages, and a new templating process using jinja that makes agents much easier to write.\nI also helped close a few issues, answer questions on GitHub, and generally be a positive member of the community.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a blog post I wrote about Empire\u0026rsquo;s plugin system here.\n","permalink":"http://dakotanelson.com/projects/contributions/empire-project/","tags":null,"title":"The Empire Project"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This talk at SOURCE Boston covers the design and use of pushpin-web, a python project which allows for collection of geotagged social media data from several different platforms in near real-time.\n  \nThere is a companion project page for this talk here.\n","permalink":"http://dakotanelson.com/publications/monitoring-social-media/","tags":null,"title":"Monitoring Social Media in 5 Minutes a Week"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This talk at the DEF CON 25 Recon Village covers Recoll, a full-text search tool which I\u0026rsquo;ve found to be incredibly useful.\n  \nThere is a companion blog post to this talk here.\n","permalink":"http://dakotanelson.com/publications/total-recoll/","tags":null,"title":"Total Recoll"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This series of blog posts introduces the reader to steganography, the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.

Do you monitor data uploaded to them? This trust can be abused to smuggle critical business data past perimeter defenses. Instead of building and maintaining custom infrastructure to control malicious software, attackers can simply rely on legitimate third parties to transport their data for them.\nSneaky-creeper is an open-source project that allows security professionals to emulate the tactics of these advanced adversaries quickly and without expensive custom tools. Its permissive license and modular design allow for the easy addition of additional transport methods to tailor an assessment for your unique requirements.\n","permalink":"http://dakotanelson.com/projects/creations/sneaky-creeper/","tags":null,"title":"Sneaky-Creeper Social Media C2"},{"categories":null,"contents":" This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.\nNo content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html\nSetting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.\nThis implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js\nInitial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml\n[outputs] home = [\u0026quot;HTML\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;JSON\u0026quot;]  Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.\nEdit layouts/_default/index.JSON This exposes the values in /index.json i.e. add category\n... \u0026quot;contents\u0026quot;:{{ .Content | plainify | jsonify }} {{ if .Params.tags }}, \u0026quot;tags\u0026quot;:{{ .Params.tags | jsonify }}{{end}}, \u0026quot;categories\u0026quot; : {{ .Params.categories | jsonify }}, ...
