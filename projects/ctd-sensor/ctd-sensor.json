  "description": "For a circuits class final project, my team decided on a conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) sensor, sometimes called a sonde. While I assembled the sensor electronics and wrote the code, the team figured out how we were going to manage to drop a tube of electronics into a lake and still manage to sample conductivity, temperature, and pressure. With the help of lots of epoxy, we managed to assemble a working system. Check out our schematics and results below, or read the <a href=\"projects/ctd-sensor/RWM_Final_Project.pdf\">full PDF report</a>.",
