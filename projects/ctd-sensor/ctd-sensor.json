  "description": "For a circuits class final project, my team decided on a conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) sensor, sometimes called a sonde. We sourced parts and whipped up a design, and while I assembled the sensor electronics and wrote the code, the team figured out how we were going to manage to drop a tube of electronics into a lake. With luck and lots of epoxy, we assembled a working system. Check out our results below, or read the <a href='projects/ctd-sensor/RWM_Final_Project.pdf'>full PDF report</a>.",
